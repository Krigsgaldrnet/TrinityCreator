Trinity Creator is a database interface that helps World of Warcraft server developers with creating items, creatures, quests and more.  
This tool is useful for both beginners; supporting a variety of vanilla through Wrath of the Lich King emulators.  
It is possible to add support for custom emulators, specific versions of emulators or repacks.

### Before you download ###
Trinity Creator is NOT a hack. You cannot use it to insert items in the private server you play on.  
It's strictly used to help server admins with custom content development.  

### Getting started ###
* [Download & install the latest version](https://github.com/Krigsgaldrnet/TrinityCreator/releases/latest)
* Use the top menu to select your emulator
* Enter your database info & DBC directory (optional, adds extra features)
* Start creating!
NOTE: You need to reload tables or restart your server before you can see your new creation.

### Currently supported emulators ###
* TrinityCore WotLK 3.3.5a (2020-01 database)
* TrinityCore WotLK 3.3.5a (2016-06 database)
* AzerothCore WotLK 3.3.5a
* cMangos WotLK 303.5a (Latest compiled)
* Light's Hope Emulator 1.12.2 (Brotalnia repack v16)
* VMaNGOS 1.12.2 (Brotalnia Repack v17)

***V1.1 Update:*** You can add support for any emulator as long as it's WotLK or lower, by using the Profile Creator tool.  
Making edits to existing profiles for slightly newer or older versions of a specific emulator has also been made easy.

Known issues: There are specific fields set up for 1.12 emulators as well. But you may have issues with Cataclysm and newer versions of WoW.

You can contribute any profiles you create at [Krigsgaldrnet/TrinityCreatorProfiles](https://github.com/NotCoffee418/TrinityCreatorProfiles).
